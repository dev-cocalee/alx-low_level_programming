A year ago, today, I graduated from secondary school. I had dreams, aspirations and every one thought me to be ambitious. My parents said I was going to be a bright child, my uncle-in-law thought me to be very smart for my age and everyone said “Zaina is a smart child”

They were right. Zainab really is smart. Zainab has dreams and Zainab is brilliant.
